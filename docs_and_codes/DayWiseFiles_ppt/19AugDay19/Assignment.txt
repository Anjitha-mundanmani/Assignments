1.Define a class named Circle which can be constructed by a radius.
 The Circle class has a method which can compute the area.
-Implement + operation (Perform addition of radius)
-Implement documentation attribute(__doc__ attribute)
-Implement string typecasting and print "The radius is ..value.."(__str__)


2.Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length 
and width. The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area.
-Implement + operation (Perform addition of length and width)
-Implement documentation attribute(__doc__ attribute)
-Implement string typecasting and print "The length is ..value.. and width is ..value.."(__str__)
-Implement > operation(__gt__(self,other) and return true or false if area is greater or smaller)
-Implement == operation(__eq__(self,other) and return true or false if area is equal or not)

3.Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class
 has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes
 have a area function which can print the area of the shape 
where Shape's area is 0 by default.
-Use math function to perform here calculation
